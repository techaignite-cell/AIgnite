<p><b>Illustration.</b></p>

<p>
C is a child, P is a parent, and DF is a Data Fiduciary. A user account of C is sought to be
created on the online platform of DF, by processing the personal data of C.
</p>

<p>
<b>Case 1:</b> C informs DF that she is a child and declares P as her parent. DF shall enable P to
identify herself through its website, app or other appropriate means. P identifies herself as

account, DF shall check to confirm that it holds reliable identity and age details of P and that
P is an identifiable adult.
</p>

<p>
<b>Case 4:</b> P is opening an account for C and identifies herself as C’s parent and informs DF
that she herself is not a registered user on DF’s platform. Before processing C’s personal
data for the creation of her user account, DF shall, by reference to identity and age details
issued by an entity entrusted by law or the Government with maintenance of the said details
or to a virtual token mapped to the identity and age, check that P is an identifiable adult. P
may voluntarily make such details available using the services of a Digital Locker service
provider.
